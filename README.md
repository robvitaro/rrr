# rrr (rob's rss reader)

## What it is
It's an rss reader made in [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

This little project has allowed me to play with and learn:
* [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [test-unit](https://github.com/test-unit/test-unit)
* [mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha)

## What it is not
Very robust. This may change as I learn more.
